=============

Internet of Things demonstration - never stay out of beer again!

The repo contains all source code for the Spark core, the NodeRED flow that check the light sensor threshold and sends a SMS through Twilio and a sample Glassware app for sending noticiations on google glass.

Try the glassware app at http://mobiledemo.compose-project.eu/mirror/beeraculus.php on Google glass
to send a message to the Glass it should work by making a GET request like:
http://mobiledemo.compose-project.eu/mirror/beeraculus.php?message='this is a message from Beeraculus!'
