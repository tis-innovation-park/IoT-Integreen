* * * Notice * * *: please do not overload the webservices and use them in
a fair way. Try to reduce information fetching as much as possible, also
to provide other users with enough bandwith. Thanks!
For any further need (malfunction, downtime, enhancements, usage
clarifications...) please contact TIS innovation park,

Tool:
- convTimeInte.js: converts UNIX timestamps into cleartext dates, is appended to
  the curl commands: | ./convTimeInte.js
  Works eg. for "get-records" and "get-date-of-last-record".
  Attention: when the returned dataset is big, the JSON records get splitted
  up in more transmission chunks in which case the tool may fail.
